                    <p>I am learning how to insert an object from a different file, as in using a module. My copilot trial version is running out. My client is a designer, photographer, that needs a website to explore, to imagine, to showcase, to document. It is a webpage that I build using my React learning. It would be cool to have images of surfing, climbing, practicing the feng shui of design.</p>
                    <p>The thought process behind this is that to import this text as a module I had to make a package.json file with "type"="module", and had to research how to do it. I looked up the import and export words in devdocs. I was very happy when it finally worked. Now I wonder whether it will work with the react page as well. üêõ I also learned how to run javascript files on the command line, which is "node name_of_file.js"</p>
                    <p>I couldn't figure out how to import components from outside script files inside my HTML page. It feels like it is against the TAO, I will try to find a more flow way of learning, perhaps continuing with the basic React tutorial.</p>

      Note: this page is a great way to try React but it's not suitable for production.
      It slowly compiles JSX with Babel in the browser and uses a large development build of React.

      Read this section for a production-ready setup with JSX:
      https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html#add-jsx-to-a-project

      In a larger project, you can use an integrated toolchain that includes JSX instead:
      https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html

      You can also use React without JSX, in which case you can remove Babel:
