                <p>Today I am working on flexbox and gaining inspiration from Pinterest. I tried to recreate ideas taking small steps. I was trying to figure out why my flexbox overlaps, finally I left the page at a messy mistakeful stage ðŸ˜Œ. I was inspired by surfer posters, waves and the ocean.</p>

      Note: this page is a great way to try React but it's not suitable for production.
      It slowly compiles JSX with Babel in the browser and uses a large development build of React.

      Read this section for a production-ready setup with JSX:
      https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html#add-jsx-to-a-project

      In a larger project, you can use an integrated toolchain that includes JSX instead:
      https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html

      You can also use React without JSX, in which case you can remove Babel:
      https://reactjs.org/docs/react-without-jsx.html
