                <p>I spent half an hour creating a webpage and I am quite happy about it, because it is much more than I usually spend with front end development and I made progress! Otherwise I spend most of the day learning. I listened to the latest Huberman Lab podcast episode and found that 90 minutes focused learning bouts are ideal and in harmony with our ultradian cycles. I aim to do one of these 90 minutes learning/working bouts per day. I applied to an apprenticeship and I am happy that I did. I am still practicing trusting these early steps without judgement. It is a great practice, it makes me very productive and creative.</p>

                <p>I started creative coding and added a p5.js canvas to a html page and used a simple Bootstrap grid.</p>

              <li><a href="daily-page/004-page.html">#4 page</a>
                <p>I put this webpage together in a few minutes as a habit building exercise. It was fun.</p>

              <li><a href="daily-page/003-page.html">#3 page from third day oh yes</a>
                <p>Today I painted paintings and I created a webpage in basic React with basic grid and a great starting point I realised ideas that I had of web design and took small steps and was in the flow, int(the now).</p>

                <p>Today I am working on flexbox and gaining inspiration from Pinterest. I tried to recreate ideas taking small steps. I was trying to figure out why my flexbox overlaps, finally I left the page at a messy mistakeful stage ðŸ˜Œ. I was inspired by surfer posters, waves and the ocean.</p>

                <p>On this page I tried to create a card that I draw on paper. I spent 1 minute working on a project idea, then 5 minutes trying to create it in React which became an hour or so.</p>

      Note: this page is a great way to try React but it's not suitable for production.
      It slowly compiles JSX with Babel in the browser and uses a large development build of React.

      Read this section for a production-ready setup with JSX:
      https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html#add-jsx-to-a-project

      In a larger project, you can use an integrated toolchain that includes JSX instead:
      https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html

      You can also use React without JSX, in which case you can remove Babel:
