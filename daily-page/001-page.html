                    <p>I am learning how to insert an object from a different file, as in using a module. My copilot trial version is running out. My client is a designer, photographer, that needs a website to explore, to imagine, to showcase, to document. It is a webpage that I build using my React learning. It would be cool to have images of surfing, climbing, practicing the feng shui of design.</p>
                    <p>The thought process behind this is that to import this text as a module I had to make a package.json file with "type"="module", and had to research how to do it. I looked up the import and export words in devdocs. I was very happy when it finally worked. Now I wonder whether it will work with the react page as well. üêõ I also learned how to run javascript files on the command line, which is "node name_of_file.js"</p>
                    <p>I couldn't figure out how to import components from outside script files inside my HTML page. It feels like it is against the TAO, I will try to find a more flow way of learning, perhaps continuing with the basic React tutorial.</p>

            {user.name.slice(1)}, the thought process behind this idea is that I looked at an old capture of Climbing magazine in the <i>Wayback</i> machine and I took a small idea, which is styling the first character of the paragraph in navy color and making it bold. I'm not sure what the font tag and the big does but nevertheless this doesn't seem to be an accessible idea as there is no p tag to mark up this paragraph. This is written inside a React component. üèù

      Note: this page is a great way to try React but it's not suitable for production.
      It slowly compiles JSX with Babel in the browser and uses a large development build of React.

      Read this section for a production-ready setup with JSX:
      https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html#add-jsx-to-a-project

      In a larger project, you can use an integrated toolchain that includes JSX instead:
      https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html

      You can also use React without JSX, in which case you can remove Babel:
