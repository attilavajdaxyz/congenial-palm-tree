    <h1 class="hello-world">Hello, world!</h1></div>
    <p>This is a daily web page, I am creating with Bootstrap. Hopefully it will be something creative and fun/engaging. I could use this space as a sketchbook for ideation and ideas generation, which is an important part of the design process. I could also write an essay between these tags, but I think I won't. I am grateful for this morning's cup of coffee. We went for a walk with Juci, my friend and we picked a bagful of rubbish from the side of the dirt road.It is a nice morning, I heard a blackbird singing from a pine tree and there is the everpresent murmur of the highway and the nearby iron factory. I have a paper serviette with intricate illstrations of birds and cherry blossom, and I wonder what it is in terms of UX design. It is so beautiful, I wouldn't want to wipe my mouth with it. I scanned the serviette and it can be a good starting point to this adventure. Experience. Whatnot. The paper's folds could serve as a basic grid. I am starting out with basic CSS and semantic HTML. I often try to think of some idea that I cannot realise and the solution seems to be going with ideas that are easy to do. For example not creating a new grid, but using a working idea with Bootstrap and further developing it. The type="text/css" attribute is obsolete, so I will not use one in the head tag for this page. Nevertheless I will link this HTML document to a CSS stylesheet which is in the same folder. To this end you can use href="./bla-bla-bla.css" in your link tag. This is a minified tutorial. A seed. I very much liked the HELLO WORLD! title that I made in a previous page, I will try to recreate it here. It had an aquamarine or aqua color. Today I found a tube, an empty tube of tempera paint in the dirt. It used to have Kobaltimitation color paint in it. I am sad that my copilot subscription expired and that I cannot subscribe to use this great tool. If only I was contributing regularly to an open source project. Perhaps when I have better skills as a developer I can. I am using Stack Overflow's AI code completion which is perfect.</p>

    <p>But let's get back to the Hello World! title. How do I solve a problem, what do I do when I have to solve a problem? Something like this was a question at an interview and so when I have to find the right font-family for this Hello World! title I look up the HTML script that I wrote and its corresponding stylesheet that has the aquamarine font. Now, my idea is to create graphic design on the screen, in the browser. Styling this title is a simple step. My mind protests: "my mind is lorem ipsum". Where is the team where there are no interviews and interview questions? This is a good podcast episode on interviewing for developers, or rather non-interviewing: <a href="https://changelog.com/news/tech-job-interview-support-group-rXny">Tech Job Interview Support Group</a></p>
